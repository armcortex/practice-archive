Diving deep into the mesmerizing world of the PSO algorithm, we've created a MATLAB-based tool to explore the complex terrains of the Himmelblau Function. Let's explore!

## ðŸ”¥ Highlights
### 1. PSO Magic on MATLAB:
Harness the power of 1000 particles unleashed in the vast expanse of the Himmelblau Function, hunting for that elusive lowest point.

### 2. Inspired by Originality:
Our project didn't just spring out of thin air. We dove into the OG research papers, connecting the dots from foundational concepts to our implementation.

### 3. Experience the Algorithmic Might:
This isn't just about number-crunching. It's a journey through the mathematical landscape, feeling the raw power of the PSO algorithm.
